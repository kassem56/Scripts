# Scripts

The first Script is about performing network connectivity tests aimed at simplifying troubleshooting for end-users, who can run the script and report back to the system administrator on whether each test was successful. The script will check connectivity to the gateway, a remote IP address, and a URL to verify that DNS resolution is functioning properly.

The second Script automates the process of adding local Linux user accounts, streamlining the task and reducing its repetitiveness for improved efficiency in the future.

The third Script is about creating and deleting symbolic links.

The fourth Script generates a report that can be run on the organization's servers to analyze the system log file for the attacks. It will report to show the IP address, the number of failed login attempts, if the number of attempts is greater than or equal to ten, the country of origin, and the report's date.
